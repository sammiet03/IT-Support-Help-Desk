### Windows Server 2016 Hands-On Virtual Lab 
- For this project, I wanted to learn more about virtualization, Windows Server 2016, and Active Directory.

##### Things Needed to Create this Lab 
- VirtualBox
- Windows 10 ISO File 

3 Separate Virtual Machines
- 1 as the Domain Controller, where you can see all other PCs.
- 1 as the Help Desk PC, where you will troubleshoot issues/simulate the type of PC you would be using during a job.
- 1 as the Client PC, where all issues will occur/where you will "break things".
